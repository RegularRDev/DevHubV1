# DevHub (Not in operative, maybe possible revamp soon )
What is Devhub?
Devhub is an new script, but no an simple script (i think lmao)
Devhub is an script suite which brings many scripts inside and includes options, for example a motorcycle spawner for Motorcycle mayhem and many more!
Who works on DevHub? InterKaos, the host of the idea, RegularRDev, the main developer of devhub (me) and MrNoob, my friend and semi-developer
